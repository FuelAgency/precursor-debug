## Getting started

The debug module is a quick and painless responsive break-point debugger. Install the module and add minimal markup to demonstrate where your site is breaking on devices.

## Settings
  - fullDebug: Hides everything, except the debug element. Useful if you're site is totally broken!

## Markup

```html
    &lt;div class=&quot;test-row&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```

## Files
  - Debug.less: Edit this file
  - Debug.css: Compiled version of this module
